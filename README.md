Hi, if you're the SYDE252 TA reading this, happy holidays!

You can listen to all the audio files in an organized format on the project's website: https://signals-final-project-website.vercel.app/
Our group made this website in order to compare the audios side-by-side.

If you have any questions about the code (or if somehow it doesn't work when you pull it locally!), please email me / Teams.
I am reachable at vstoica@uwaterloo.ca and reply quickly. 

Thanks,
Valerie
